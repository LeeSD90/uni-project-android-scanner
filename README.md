# Android barcode scanner
Made as part of my final year university project, an Android application written in Java which implements the ZXing library.

It provides the ability to scan and save product barcodes, view a history of saved barcodes and to attempt to find information on scanned/saved barcodes via REST requests to Amazon/Ebay.
